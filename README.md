The database "application_portal" has 4 tables in order to satisfy the project requirements: Applicants, Jobs_Listing, Jobs_Applicants and Employers. 
The table "Jobs_Applicants" was created in order to make a correct many-to-many relationship between "Applicants" and "Jobs_Listing", as an Applicant can apply to multiple jobs and also multiple Applicants can apply to a certain job. We can also observe the "one-to-many" relationship between "Employers" and "Jobs_Listing", as the Job Offers are posted by Employers, and each Employer can post multiple jobs, but one job cannot be posted by multiple Employers, because (I supposed) each employer posts its available offers and the company cannot have two or more job offers that are the same.
I have set some common fields to each table and populated them with the requested values (chosen by me).
